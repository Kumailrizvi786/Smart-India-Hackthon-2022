                    Writing Month) and end up with a bestseller. Others start with a meticulous outline and structured
                    plan. Some (usually not novelists) can get a publication deal on a pitch alone. This article is
                    meant to talk through the various steps involved and help you decide the best way for you to write
                    your book.
